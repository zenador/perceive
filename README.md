## Description

A guessing game with conflicting info. Quick and simple. At least 3 players, preferably more.

At the start of the game, players take turns to view the info available to them. The good players are given hints to find the right answer, and the evil players try to confuse them (they are not given hints, and they may or may not know the right answer depending on your settings).

After discussion and reaching a group consensus, players can start guessing by tapping the name of the choice to see if it is correct.

Alternatively, instead of getting the players who viewed info to reach a group consensus, you could have a separate player (or group) who does not get to view any of the info boxes (and who does not contribute to the count of good or evil players when setting up the game) listen to everyone's input and then make the decision on their own.
